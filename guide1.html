<p style="text-align:justify">In our forex signals terminal, you will find the following information:

Pair/Instrument – The relevant currency pair or instrument, e.g. gold, bitcoin, Nikkei, etc.
Status – The current status of the signal (just below the instrument’s symbol).
Active: As long as a signal is active, traders are advised to follow the alert and enter the market!
Get Ready: Be prepared. There is a good chance that the system is about to open a new position. The ‘Get Ready’ signal might become ‘Active’ or disappear.
Closed: The signal is no longer active and has been closed by our system.
Action – (Buy or Sell) Next to the instrument’s symbol and current price, a BUY or SELL action is indicated in green and red, respectively.
Entry Price – Premium members have access to the entry price of each trading signal.
Stop Loss – An automatic exit point to protect your investment. This is the suggested price at which to exit the trade in case the market goes against you. Make sure you apply a stop loss when opening the position in your trading account.
Take Profit – This is the suggested target price at which to exit the trade. When the price reaches your take profit order, your position will automatically close. It is recommended that you place a take profit order with every trade to lock in your profit in case the target price is reached.
Trade Now – If you haven’t opened a trading account yet, the ‘Trade Now’ button will lead you to our top recommended broker and trading platform. If you already have a trading account, you can start using our trading signals straight away.
Comments – Directly below the entry price, you will see different comments related to the particular trading signal. If any changes to stop loss or take profit orders have been made, it will also be published in this space.
Pay Attention! There are 3 different ways for a signal to get closed:

Automatically, by reaching the stop loss level.
Automatically, by reaching the take profit level.
Closing the forex signals manually by our team of analysts – We close the signal if we believe that it is the right timing to exit the market, considering the momentum and other technical/fundamental factors. “The signal has closed manually at xxx price” is the comment displayed in the comments section (right below the entry price).
All of our signals are based on technical analysis of forex (and other) charts, as well as fundamental analysis of economic events and the latest market news.

As you can see, it´s not complicated to follow our forex signals. Once a signal appears live on our signals page or once you get an alert on your phone, open a trade at the spot price and apply the specified stop loss and take profit parameters. Sometimes, we issue comments with our signals such as “If the price gets close to our take profit, move the stop loss to breakeven”. In other cases, our analysts may suggest extending the take profit when the trade’s potential increases for whatever technical or fundamental reason.</p>
